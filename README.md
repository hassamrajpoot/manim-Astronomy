![Logo](path-to-your-logo.png) <!-- Replace with the path to your logo -->

### ✨ A Manim Extension for Creating Stunning Astronomical Visualizations

**⚠️ Currently in Development**: This plugin is a work in progress. Features and functionality may change as we refine the project!

---

## Features

- **🪐 Elliptical Orbits**: Visualize planetary orbits with accurate elliptical paths.
- **🌟 Celestial Bodies**: Create and animate stars, planets, moons, and more in a 3D space.
- **✨ Constellations**: Draw and animate constellations with custom stars and labels.
- **☀️ Solar System Models**: Build simple or complex solar system representations with customizable scales and trajectories.
- **🕳️ Space-Time Grids**: Visualize the concept of spacetime curvature using interactive grids.
- **🎨 Customizable Animations**: Adjust the speed, scale, and perspective of your space animations with ease.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) installed on your machine. Then, you can install this plugin by cloning the repository and installing the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astronomy-manim-plugin.git
cd astronomy-manim-plugin
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the plugin to create an animation of a planet orbiting a star:

```python
from manim import *
from astronomy_plugin import Planet, Orbit

class PlanetOrbit(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a star and a planet
        star = Sphere(radius=0.5, color=YELLOW).shift(LEFT)
        planet = Planet(radius=0.3, color=BLUE)
        
        # Define an elliptical orbit path for the planet
        orbit = Orbit(planet, star, semi_major_axis=3, eccentricity=0.5)
        
        # Animate the planet orbiting around the star
        self.play(Orbit(planet, around=star))
        self.wait(2)

```

### Main Components

- **Planet**: Create spherical objects representing planets, stars, or moons. 🌌
- **Orbit**: Simulate planetary orbits with customizable eccentricity and rotation speed. 🚀
- **Constellation**: Draw constellations with a set of stars and connect them. ✨
- **StarField**: Generate a 3D field of stars with configurable density and depth. 🌠
